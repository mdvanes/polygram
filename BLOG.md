Although I am used to component driven development like now common with Angular and React for instance where all resources are css/templates and tightly coherent js are grouped. 

But I am not totally convinced of web components, mainly because there is no use of virtual dom as far as I know and the difficulty of linting, minifying, test coverage when everything is wrapped in html. 

To investigate web components, I will first compare the syntax of [vanilla web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements) and [Polymer 2](https://www.polymer-project.org/) (I am still a novice in both). 
The added benefit of Polymer being the catalog of existing components (also a lot of polyfills, e.g. for html import, but those can also be used with native web components). 

As is clear in example HelloWorld/my-shadow-component.js and HelloWorld/my-polymer-component.js the difference is minimal, 
mainly

* extends Polymer.Element instead of HTMLElement
* Polymer default in shadow dom
* getter/setter easier through properties (might also be possible in vanilla web components)
* observer added directly in properties (might also be possible in vanilla web components) 

Also note that Polymer favors the HTML form (which requires the webcomponent lite polyfill) over the js form.


When looking into Polymer for Web Components, to share state between components, Redux seems like a pretty good fit.

I've found the docs on [Polymer Redux](https://tur-nr.github.io/polymer-redux/docs), but they don't really go into
details of implementation.

Also there is [this Polycast video](https://youtu.be/PahsgJn0sgU) but it applies to Polymer 1.x and I wanted
to apply it to Polymer 2.

In my [example project Polygram](https://github.com/mdvanes/polygram), everything went well from building two
  separate components, one that provides a search functionality (polygram-searchbox) and the other a detailed view (polygram-details)
  and defining actions, reducers, the store, and dispatching events work.
  
  
... Diagram of how the (immutable) state is updated ...
Click a search result
dispatch is triggered
store is updated (visible in Redux devtools)
but the value is not updated in the details view. The observer on state is not triggered.
  
In the repo for Polymer Redux is a demo for [ready-state](https://github.com/tur-nr/polymer-redux/blob/master/demo/ready-state.html)
 which shows how to initialise and pass the state. This is a very minimal but complete implementation
 that has an observer on a field, when changing this field it emits a dispatch, that updates the state
 and some other field refers to the state and updates its value. This is where I found the 
 statePath property from Polymer Redux. It allows a component to bind a property directly to the state.
 
Next up is to make the components function individually. Because at this point the demo page works where
both components are integrated, but it only initializes the Redux store there and not on the separate pages.
So I find that I have to move certain parts of the initialization (mainly this:
```
(function(Polygram) {
    // ReduxThunk (optional) for services and Redux Devtools for debugging with Chrome extension
    const store = Redux.createStore(
        Redux.combineReducers(Polygram.REDUCERS),
        Redux.compose(
            // TODO Redux.applyMiddleware(window.ReduxThunk.default),
            window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()));

    Polygram.reduxStore = store;

    Polygram.ACTIONS = Polygram.ACTIONS || {};
    Polygram.ACTIONS.TERM_SELECTED = Polygram.createTermActions();
})(window.Polygram || {});

const ReduxMixin = PolymerRedux(Polygram.reduxStore);
```
)
from polygram-element to the demo (or app) html that applies polygram-element. Now the same can be done for the
demo pages of polygram-searchbox and polygram-details to make sure ReduxMixin (and with it a reduxStore) is 
available when running integrated as well as individually on an demo page. 
Since not only this snippet but also some libraries (polymer-redux, the reducer and action) are needed in each 
instance, these are extracted to a new file: redux-mixin.html

Now the project works, you can use the Chrome plugin [Redux Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) to do "timetravel" debugging.
You can try it out by 
* opening Redux Devtools
* search for "Cat"
* click one of the results, e.g. "Bengal Cat"
* click another result, e.g. "Schr√∂dinger's cat"
* now inspect the TERM_SELECTED entries in the Redux Devtools and click "jump" on the one that set "Bengal Cat".
* The entire state is now reverted to that point. It's easy to imagine how this can be helpful with debugging
 a big application, and it is even more helpful that state can be exported and imported.
* dont forget to fastforward the debugger after you're done debugging! Otherwise you won't be able to use the application normally.

Polymer uses bower for depencencies, because there is long running issue with dependencies {refer to issue}.
Unfortunately to use Redux, the redux dependency must be installed with npm (the bower packages does not contains a dist version).
To provide for this I added a package.json to the project that has an postinstall hook that runs ```polymer serve```.
So for installation, now use ```npm install``` and then both npm and polymer dependencies are installed
and afterwards the server can be started normally with ```polymer serve```.

Trying to improve polygram-details with hiding until a term is set.
This works well on the integrated page,
but this does not work well running in demo mode because I'm still
using term="something" instead of state=[???]. It is not needed to set
state with an attribute, but setting the term attribute directly does not work,
probably because it is overriden by `statePath` in

```
term: {
    type: String,
    observer: '_termChanged',
    statePath: 'term.selectedTerm'
},

```
                    
So for now it's solved with a separate optional attribute standaloneTerm, that 
dispatches its value to the Redux store.  
Maybe there is a better way to re-use standalone elements with optional state via Redux?

Next container wrappers for different search engines.

Next test cases and CI.
