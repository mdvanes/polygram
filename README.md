# Hello World

When running `polymer serve`, it's also possible to open [http://localhost:8081/components/polygram-element/demo/HelloWorld/](http://localhost:8081/components/polygram-element/demo/HelloWorld/) for a case comparing very basic
native webcomponents and a Polymer component. 


# TODO

* Test cases, source maps (bundler?), breakpoints (breakpoints work)?
* Hydrolysis (now [Polymer Analyzer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-analyzer), used by linter and builder. 
* Vulcanisation (now [Polymer Bundler??](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-bundler)), used for packaging.
* Higher order components for switching APIs (e.g. Wiki, Getty en Marvel?)
* Add Ramdba to Redux, see [this article](https://alligator.io/react/functional-redux-reducers-with-ramda/).
* improvement paper-autocomplete?
